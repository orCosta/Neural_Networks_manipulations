# Neural_Networks_manipulations

## Mnist autoencoder
Using FC network for compressing 784 pixels to 100 pixels of info(encoder) and resize it back to 784(decoder).



graph - 2D representation of the Mnist data.


## GANs
Train network (generator) that get random vector and creates Mnist image from it. 



## Masks and patterns inside the net
Using trained net and using SGD optimizer to create a pattern of inner layers of the net.
